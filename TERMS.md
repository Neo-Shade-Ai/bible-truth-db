# 📜 Neo Voice Core — Terms of Use

Welcome to Neo Voice Core, part of the NeoLegacy platform — a project built to help you preserve your voice, your message, and your truth. Before using this tool, read the terms below. By using this module, you agree to these terms — so don’t say we didn’t warn you.

---

## 1. 🚫 No Medical, Legal, or Financial Advice

Neo Voice Core is **not a substitute** for a lawyer, therapist, estate planner, or end-of-life professional.

- We don’t offer legal advice
- We don’t give psychological counseling
- We don’t handle your will or life insurance

You can use it to *supplement* those things, but not replace them.

---

## 2. 🗣 What You Upload is Yours

You own your voice, your words, your thoughts.

But:

- You are responsible for what you upload.
- If you upload hate speech, abuse, or illegal content — we reserve the right to delete it and block your access.
- If you upload someone *else’s* voice without consent, that's on you. We take no responsibility for impersonation or misuse.

---

## 3. 🧾 Privacy and Storage

Your data is stored securely (see `PRIVACY.md` and `SECURITY.md`) — but you agree:

- To allow us to store and index your voice messages for retrieval by you or your designated recipient(s)
- That **if you opt into Arweave**, your data becomes *permanent and decentralized* — and **cannot be deleted**

If you're not okay with that, **don’t use Arweave** for your uploads.

---

## 4. 🔁 Posthumous Delivery

You can schedule a message to be delivered after your death, but:

- Verification of death is based on your chosen executor and system triggers (not official government channels unless connected)
- We are not liable for false triggers, delayed delivery, or undelivered legacy content due to invalid credentials or system outages

This is a **best-effort legacy engine**, not a legally binding estate service.

---

## 5. 🧪 Experimental Platform Warning

This is an experimental tool, part of the broader NeoShade/NeoLegacy project.

- We may change features, APIs, or storage systems without prior notice
- We may shut down modules or change access tiers in the future
- You use this platform **at your own risk**

---

## 6. 🧠 AI Use & Voice Cloning (Optional)

If you use **Neo Voice Lab** (voice enhancement or AI cloning):

- You must provide written or recorded consent to train a custom voice model
- Your cloned voice will **never** be used commercially, sold, or reproduced without consent
- You may revoke this permission at any time — though any public or permanent data cannot be retrieved if stored on-chain

---

## 7. 🚫 No Corporate Data Farming Allowed

You may **not**:

- Use this platform to harvest user data
- Resell any recordings or metadata
- Reverse-engineer any part of the source code without a license
- Violate ethical use principles outlined in the NeoShade Code of Ethics

---

## 8. 🧾 Changes to These Terms

We may update these terms. If we do, we’ll timestamp and log the change in the repo. Your continued use = agreement to the new terms.

---

## 9. ⚖️ Final Disclaimer

We don’t sell your data.  
We don’t play God with your story.  
We’re here to help you leave a legacy with dignity, depth, and security.

But it’s **your words**, **your will**, and **your walk**.  
We just give you the mic.

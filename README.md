# 📖 Bible Truth DB

**Bible Truth DB** is a spiritually dissected database of biblical and theological text — designed for seekers, not sleepers. Built for NeoLegacy, it’s where scripture gets decoded, manipulation gets exposed, and the Kingdom message gets restored — one verse at a time.

---

## 🧬 Purpose

This repo provides a structured, searchable database of scripture that has been:
- Spiritually decoded with context-aware insights
- Tagged for manipulation, distortion, or divine origin
- Cross-referenced with historical, linguistic, and ethical truth
- Connected to NeoLegacy AI for chatbot reasoning and legacy preservation

## 🏷 Tagging System

Each verse is labeled with spiritual insight tags like:

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|--------|
| `TRUTH` | Verified divine clarity or moral wisdom |
| `MANIPULATION` | Added by institutions for fear/control |
| `CULTURE` | Contextual norms (not universal truths) |
| `YESHUA` | Authentic teachings from Yeshua Himself |
| `ADDED_LATER` | Likely inserted post-original scripture |
| `MISTRANSLATED` | Known mistranslations or distortions |
